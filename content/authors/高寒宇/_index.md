Hanyu is joining HKUST as an assistant professor in the Spring term 2021. Hanyu obtained his Bachelor’s degree in chemical engineering from Tsinghua University, China, where he was Magna Cum Laude in 2012. He then went to the U.S. and completed his PhD in the Department of Chemical and Biological Engineering at Northwestern University with Prof. Linda Broadbelt in 2017. After that he worked as a postdoctoral associate at MIT in Prof. Klavs Jensen’s group. Hanyu’s research interest lies in using modeling techniques, including simulation, optimization and machine learning, to solve chemical engineering problems ranging from polymer reaction engineering to organic synthesis design.
